# Software Engineering Bootcamp

The Global Tech Program was facilitated through **Arizona State University**. During this 16-week program, we covered popular web technologies used in frontend development and completed a multitude of hands-on projects through paired programming. I have shared some of those projects here to illustrate some of the skills I developed here.
